# FatMunkey's Portfolio Project
This is a class project for a Udacity Course I am taking.  It's a portfolio website (HTML, CSS3, JavaScript and sprinkle of JQuery).

You probably won't be interested in this.  But hey, it's your world so check it out if you want to!

You can feel totally free to rip this off and make it into whatever you want.  You just have to give me half the cash...Not!  Seriously, do what you want and feel zero obligation to give me credit or anything else.

BTW:  To give credit where credit is due...

I used this codepen https://codepen.io/israelagm/pen/yVPpzV as an inspiration and a starting template for the flip cards but I redesigned it and expanded on it for my own purposes.

The classical drawings are from an old book by charles Bargue which is available for download and use all over the place.  I downloaded the PDF file here ttps://www.scribd.com/doc/316611362/Charles-Bargue-Drawing-Course-pdf.  Of course I have no intention of actually using these images for anything other than this class project.

All I ever wanted was whirled peas.

Give peas a chance.

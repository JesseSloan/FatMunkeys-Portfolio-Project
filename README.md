# FatMunkey's Portfolio Project
This is a class project for a Udacity Course I am taking.  It's a portfolio website (HTML, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4 and a sprinkle of JQuery).

You probably won't be interested in this.  But hey, it's your world so check it out if you want to!

You can feel totally free to grab this and make it into whatever you want.  You just have to give me half the cash...Not!  Seriously, do what you want and feel zero obligation to give me any credit or anything else.

BTW:  

To give credit where credit is due...

I used this codepen https://codepen.io/israelagm/pen/yVPpzV as an inspiration and a starting template for the flip cards but I redesigned it and expanded on it for my own purposes.

The smoothscrolling effect is something that I like and I wanted to see how it was done.  So I found this codepen https://codepen.io/jay22/pen/rYGwXX  I could not resist trying this out so I included the effect in my index.js file.  I did not alter the code in anyway.  

The other small bit of JQuery in my index.js file is me trying to figure out how to get the youtube embed to stop playing when the user clicks out of the modal window.  I used a bit of DOM manipulation to remove the video source and add it back in for the next time the user clicks on the video link without refreshing the page.  My solution probably is not the best solution, but it seems to work.  I only tested on in chrome.

The classical drawings are from an old book by charles Bargue which is available for download and use all over the place.  I downloaded the PDF file here ttps://www.scribd.com/doc/316611362/Charles-Bargue-Drawing-Course-pdf.  Of course I have no intention of actually using these images for anything other than this class project.

The Clint Eastwod drawing and the animation video of my Aunt Nancy are my creations.  Obviously, the song in my video is not mine!  It is "Aint No Sunshine" by Bill Withers.  I love the song, and I thought it was appropriate to the video back when I made it a couple of years ago.  No one has complained about me using the song so I guess it's probably "ok-ish" that I used it.  The video is not monitized in anyway by me.  

All I ever wanted was whirled peas.

Give peas a chance.

# FatMunkey's Portfolio Project
This is a class project for a Udacity Course I am taking.  It's a portfolio website (HTML, CSS3, JavaScript and sprinkle of JQuery).

You probably won't be interested in this.  But hey, it's your world so check it out if you want to!

You can feel totally free to rip this off and make it into whatever you want.  You just have to give me half the cash...Not!  Seriously, do what you want and feel zero obligation to give me credit or anything else.

All I ever wanted was whirled peas.

Give peas a chance.
